# webpack-boilerplate
Hi everyone 
i was trying to code without framworks like react, angular etc 
so i made this boilerplate and it's perfect
i used webpack only with bunch of plugins and loaders
feel free to use it
and if you have any issue address it
</br>

<h1>How To Use:</h1>
1- open terminal or CMD
2- clone the repo by typing this command in the terminal/cmd </br>
git clone https://github.com/ChaosEvolved/webpack-boilerplate </br>
4- open the repo folder via vscode
5- open the vscode terminal by pressing shift+`
6- type npm install so you get all the additional files you need to use this boilerplate

<h4>7- to use it as development environment (coding with dev live server and hot reloading) type in terminal <h2>npm start</h2> it also build the final bundle that automatically so you host them </h4>
8- when you finish developing just type in terminal <h3>npm run build</h3> you also get the final version of the bundle to host
