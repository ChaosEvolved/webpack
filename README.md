# webpack-boilerplate
Hi everyone 
i was trying to code without framworks like react, angular etc 
so i made this boilerplate and it's perfect
i used webpack only with bunch of plugins and loaders
feel free to use it
and if you have any issue address it.
</br>

<h1>How To Use:</h1>
1- open terminal or CMD </br>
2- clone the repo by typing this command in the terminal/cmd </br>
git clone https://github.com/ChaosEvolved/webpack-boilerplate </br>
3- open the repo folder via vscode </br>
4- open the vscode terminal by pressing shift+` </br>
5- type npm install so you get all the additional files you need to use this boilerplate </br>

6- to use it as development environment (coding with dev live server and hot reloading) type in terminal npm start it also build the final bundle automatically so you host them.
7- when you finish developing just type in terminal npm run build you also get the final version of the bundle to host.
