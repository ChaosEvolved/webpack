# webpack-boilerplate
Hi everyone 
i was trying to code without framworks like react, angular etc 
so i made this boilerplate and it's perfect
i used webpack only with different plugins and loaders
feel free to use it and if u have any issue address it
bye bye <3

How To Use:

open terminal or CMD
clone the repo by typing this command in the terminal/cmd
git clone https://github.com/ChaosEvolved/webpack-boilerplate
open the repo folder via vscode
open the vscode terminal by pressing shift+`
type npm install so you get all the additional files you need to use this boilerplate
